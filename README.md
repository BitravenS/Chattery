This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The backend code for the project will be found in the [backend](https://github.com/BitravenS/Chattery-backend) repo. Also make sure to create a Postgres container inside `docker-compose.yml` in the backend deployment to be able to run it locally, as the current version is running on `railway.app`.
